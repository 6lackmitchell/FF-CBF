The work in this repository was conducted for our paper submission to the 2023 American Control Conference:

### Future-Focused Control Barrier Functions for Autonomous Vehicle Control

Authors: Mitchell Black, Mrdjan Jankovic, Abhishek Sharma, and Dimitra Panagou

In the video below ([watch on YouTube here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JPgKf1qCJM)), we applied a decentralized CBF-QP based control scheme using our relaxed future-focused CBF for collision avoidance to a 5-rover collection of ground rovers modeled as bicycles. This video highlights our controllers success in solving an intersection crossing problem when the vehicles present are non-communicating (i.e. can sense one anothers' states but have no knowledge of intentions).
